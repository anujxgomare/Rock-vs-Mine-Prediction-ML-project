# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-ML-project
A machine learning project predicting whether a sample is rock or mine based on sensor data and features.

The **Rock vs Mine Prediction** project uses machine learning algorithms to classify samples as either "rock" or "mine" based on various sensor data or features. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between the two classes, which could represent geological materials in a mining context. 

### Key Components of the Project:
1. **Data Collection**: Data is typically collected from sensors or other sources, capturing features such as seismic, acoustic, or vibration data from rocks and mines.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for analysis. This step may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Important features (such as chemical composition, density, and texture) are extracted from the raw data to help improve the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy.

4. **Model Development**: Various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or neural networks are trained to differentiate between rock and mine samples. The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The model is validated and tested on a separate set of data to ensure its robustness and generalization to unseen samples.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**: The trained model can be deployed in real-world mining operations for real-time classification of samples.

### Use Case:
This project can be applied in areas like **mining**, where quickly distinguishing between rock and mine materials is crucial for safety and operational efficiency.
